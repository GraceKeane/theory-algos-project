## Repository Description 
Description of your repository and its contents pitched at a knowledgeable outsider.

## SHA512 Overview
Explain & why is it important?

## Software Requirements

## Running the Program
1. In your command line terminal: ```git clone https://github.com/GraceKeane/theory-algos-project.git```<br>
2. Navigate to the <b> \program\ </b> directory: ```cd program```<br>
3. Compile the program: ```make bitoperations```<br>
4. Execute the program: ```./bitoperations```<br>

- Add screencasts to explain how to run & code snippets

## Project Implementation
- Add code snippets & explain how my code works

## Assignment Questions 
<b>Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?</b><br>

<b>Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?</b><br>

<b>How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?</b><br>
